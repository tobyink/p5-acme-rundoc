This isn't really a FAQ.

There are some examples bundled with the installation, but they are
not installed by default. If you grab a copy of the "word-examples"
and "word-lib" directories though, you ought to be able to run them
like this (assuming Acme::RunDoc and icrosoft::Word are installed on
your system)...

# Example .doc
perl -Microsoft::Word 'word-examples/helloworld.doc'

# Example .docm
perl -Iword-lib -MAcme::RunDoc=Hello::World -E'greet;'
